            You must GPG-sign your work, certifying that you either wrote the work or otherwise have the right to pass it on to an open-source project. See Developer's Certificate of Origin.
            See [signing][1].

            **Note that all your commits must be signed.** If you have an unsigned commit, you can sign the previous commits by referring to [gpg-signing-old-commits][2].

            **Unit Testing:**
            Unit testing is expected for all CodeIgniter components. We use PHPUnit, and run unit tests using GitHub Actions for each PR submitted or changed.

            **So please write a unit test or update the existing tests.**

            See  [unit testing][1] for more info.
