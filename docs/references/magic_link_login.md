# Magic Link Login

Magic Link Login is a feature that allows users to log in if they forget their
password.

## Configuration

### Configure Magic Link Login Functionality

Magic Link Login functionality is enabled by default.
You can change it within the **app/Config/Auth.php** file.

```php
public bool $allowMagicLinkLogins = true;
```

### Magic Link Lifetime

By default, Magic Link can be used for 1 hour. This can be easily modified
in the **app/Config/Auth.php** file.

```php
public int $magicLinkLifetime = HOUR;
```

### Magic Link Force Login

By default, Magic Link will throw Logic exception if current user session is exist. If you want replace existing user session with new user session change it to `true`
in the **app/Config/Auth.php** file.

```php
public bool $allowMagicLinkForceLogin = false;
```

## Responding to Magic Link Logins

!!! note

    You need to configure **app/Config/Email.php** to allow Shield to send emails. See [Installation](../getting_started/install.md#initial-setup).

Magic Link logins allow a user that has forgotten their password to have an email sent with a unique, one-time login link. Once they've logged in you can decide how to respond. In some cases, you might want to redirect them to a special page where they must choose a new password. In other cases, you might simply want to display a one-time message prompting them to go to their account page and choose a new password.

### Session Notification

You can detect if a user has finished the magic link login by checking for a session value, `magicLogin`. If they have recently completed the flow, it will exist and have a value of `true`.

```php
if (session('magicLogin')) {
    return redirect()->route('set_password');
}
```

This value sticks around in the session for 5 minutes. Once you no longer need to take any actions, you might want to delete the value from the session.

```php
session()->removeTempdata('magicLogin');
```

### Event

At the same time the above session variable is set, a `magicLogin` [event](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/extending/events.html) is fired off that you may subscribe to. Note that no data is passed to the event as you can easily grab the current user from the `user()` helper or the `auth()->user()` method.

```php
Events::on('magicLogin', static function () {
    // ...
});
```
