Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. While it does provide a base set of tools
that are commonly used in websites, it is designed to be flexible and easily customizable.

The primary goals for Shield are:
1. It must be very flexible and allow developers to extend/override almost any part of it.
2. It must have security at its core. It is an auth lib after all.
3. To cover many auth needs right out of the box, but be simple to add additional functionality to.

## Authentication Methods

Shield provides two primary methods **Session-based** and **Personal Access Codes**
of authentication out of the box.

It also provides **JSON Web Tokens** authentication.

### Session-based

This is your typical email/username/password system you see everywhere. It includes a secure "remember me" functionality.
This can be used for standard web applications, as well as for single page applications. Includes full controllers and
basic views for all standard functionality, like registration, login, forgot password, etc.

### Personal Access Codes

These are much like the access codes that GitHub uses, where they are unique to a single user, and a single user
can have more than one. This can be used for API authentication of third-party users, and even for allowing
access for a mobile application that you build.

### JSON Web Tokens

JWT or JSON Web Token is a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting
information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication
and authorization purposes in web applications.

## Some Important Features

* Session-based authentication (traditional email/password with remember me)
* Stateless authentication using Personal Access Tokens
* Optional Email verification on account registration
* Optional Email-based Two Factor Authentication after login
* Magic Login Links when a user forgets their password
* Flexible groups-based access control (think roles, but more flexible)
* Users can be granted additional permissions

See the [An Official Auth Library](https://codeigniter.com/news/shield) for more Info.
